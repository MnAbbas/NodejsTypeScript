## Project Structure
The most obvious difference in a TypeScript + Node project is the folder structure.
In a TypeScript project, it's best to have separate _source_  and _distributable_ files.
TypeScript (`.ts`) files live in your `src` folder and after compilation are output as JavaScript (`.js`) in the `dist` folder.
The `test` and `views` folders remain top level as expected.
